### 2022

1. Show that the ordinary demand curve will have greater demand elasticity than the compensated demand curve.(5 Marks)

2. (a)Define the indirect utility function.Derive the indirect utility finction from the direct utity    function.
   (6 marks)

   (b)consider the indirect utility function.
   $V=\frac{M^2}{4P_1 P_2}$
   Where notations have their usual meaning.Derive the demand function for $x_1$ and $x_2$. 
   (6 marks)
  
   (c). consider the utility function and the budget equation of a consumer respectively.
  
   $U=x_1 x_2$,
  
   $M=p_1 x_1 +p_2 x_2$
  
   where notations have their usual meaning.
   Derive the expenditure function of the consumer.
   ( 6 marks)

4. Show that the elasticity of demand is same at all points on the demand curve:

   $x=ap^{-\alpha}$

   $a,\alpha$ : parameters

   x: quantity demand

   p: price 
   (5 marks)


   consider the demand function of 2 goods $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively.

   $x_1=p_1 ^{-0.7} p_2 ^{0.2}$

   and $x_2=p_1^{0.6}p_2^{-0.4}$

   Determine whether commodities are complementary or competitive.
