### 2022

1. Show that the ordinary demand curve will have greater demand elasticity than the compensated demand curve.(5 Marks)

2. (a)Define the indirect utility function.Derive the indirect utility finction from the direct utity    function.
   (6 marks)

   (b)consider the indirect utility function.
   $V=\frac{M^2}{4P_1 P_2}$
   Where notations have their usual meaning.Derive the demand function for $x_1$ and $x_2$. 
   (6 marks)
  
   (c). consider the utility function and the budget equation of a consumer respectively.
  
   $U=x_1 x_2$,
  
   $M=p_1 x_1 +p_2 x_2$
  
   where notations have their usual meaning.
   Derive the expenditure function of the consumer.
   ( 6 marks)

4. Show that the elasticity of demand is same at all points on the demand curve:

   $x=ap^{-\alpha}$

   $a,\alpha$ : parameters

   x: quantity demand

   p: price 
   (5 marks)


   consider the demand function of 2 goods $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively.

   $x_1=p_1 ^{-0.7} p_2 ^{0.2}$

   and $x_2=p_1^{0.6}p_2^{-0.4}$

   Determine whether commodities are complementary or competitive.
   ( 6 marks)



#### 2021

1. Define homothetic preferences.explain the common characteristics of such preferences with help of necessary diagrams.(5 marks)

2. suppose the utiliy function for the consumer akes on the following form :

   - $U=50x+20y$
   - $U=20X+50Y$
   - $U=80X+40Y$

   The budget of the consumer is 10000.the prices of good$x$ and $y$ are 50 nd 20 per unit respectively.Determine the possibility of determination of equilibrium basket in each case using comment and diagram on the nature of solution.(12 marks)


#### 2020

1. The demand and supply functions are $P_D =(6-X)^2$ and $P_S =14+X$ respectively . Find the consumer surplus under pure competitive market.(5 marks)
2. Derive slutsky equation and interpret it. (5 marks)
3. Given the utility function as 
   $12y=36-x^2$
   and the budget line as 
   $M=12x+24y$
   Determine the utility maximizing basket of the two goods.(8 marks)
