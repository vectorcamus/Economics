1. A compensated demand curve ignores the income effect of a price change.It only measures the substitution effect. A compensated demand curve is therefore less elastic than an ordinary demand curve.
   
   as we know the compensated own price effect is negative . 
   
   $\frac{\partial h_i(p,u)}{\partial p_i}= \frac{\partial ^2 e(p,u)}{\partial p_i ^{2}} \leq 0$
   
   $\frac{\partial h_i(p,u)}{\partial p_i}= \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial p_i} -\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} \frac{\partial E}{\partial p_x}$
   
   multiplying both sides by $\frac {p_i}{x_i}$ we get,
   
   
   $\frac{\partial h_i(p,u)}{\partial p_i} \frac {p_i}{x_i}= \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial p_i} -\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} \frac{\partial E}{\partial p_x} \frac {p_i}{x_i}$
   
   $\epsilon _{h_i,p_i}= \epsilon _{x_i,p_i} - \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial I} \frac{\partial E}{\partial p_i}$

2. The indirect utility function is

   $V=\frac{M^2}{4p_1 p_2}$
   
   $\frac{\partial V}{\partial M}= \frac{2M}{4p_1 p_2}$
   
   and
   
   $\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_1}= - \frac{M^2}{4p_2 p_1 ^2}$
   
   from Roy's identity we get that 
   
   $x_1^* = - \frac{\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_1}}{\frac{\partial V}{\partial M}}=-(\frac{- \frac{M^2}{4p_2 p_1 ^2}}{\frac{2M}{4p_1 p_2}})$
   
   $\implies x_1^* = \frac{M}{2p_1}$
   
   Likewise 
   
   $x_2^*= - \frac{\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_2}}{\frac{\partial V}{\partial M}}=-(\frac{-  \frac{M^2}{4p_1 p_2 ^2}}{\frac{2M}{4p_1 p_2}})$
  
   $\implies x_2^* = \frac {M}{2p_2}$
