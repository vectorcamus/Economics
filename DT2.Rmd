**Solve any 3**

1. Show that the lexicographic preference relation satisfies rationality.

2. Prove that the MRS of a homothetic preference relation is homogeneous of degree zero.

3. Prove that homotheticity does not imply homogeneity.

4. what is the economic interpretation of  convexity of indifference curves ?

5. prove that If a preference relation satisfies monotonicity and continuity, then there exists a utility function u(âˆ™) representing such preference relation.

6. what is the difference between quasi-concavity and strict quasi -concavity of utility fuctions ?

7. which of the following function satisfies convexity and strict convexity ? 
    - $ax_1 +bx_2$
    - $min(ax_1+bx_2)$
    - $ax_1^{\frac{1}{2}} bx_2^{\frac{1}{2}}$
    - $ax_1^2 bx_2 ^2$
    
8. What is an utility function ?

9. why indifference curve are not supposed to intersect each other ?

10. If $U=-2x-3y$ ,  $P_x=0$ , $P_y=2$ and income =100 $ what will be the optimal bundle for the consumer ?
