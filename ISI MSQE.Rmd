**Microeconomics**

Look at the question paper. Everything is more or less an Intermediate level optimization problem with sound  economic logic. You need to know optimal consumption , production , properties of market equilibrium, game theory , optimal wages ,endowment as well as general equilibrium.

for basic production you can refer [osborne university_of _toronto](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/2x3/tutorial/index.html)

You can read hal varian and snyder, nicholson. This is the traditional combination. But Hal varian itself does not have numericals. It has a [test bank]() and [workbook](). You can do it selectively as most of us do not have time to solve all the question.snyder nicholson end chapter exercise are helpful both for pea and peb perspective.

but there are 2 books which works as a nice alternative and have integrated combination  of theory and numerical.

i. Intermediate microeconomics by samiran banerjee, a tool building approach.
2. Intermediate micro a step by step guide by garcia 


just look at the bookss you will know.

samiran banerjee chapter 2 has a portion called non competitive budget. read that. in garcia book you will know how to find income and substitution effect and intersting utility functions.

special mention- amit goyals [you tube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmitGoyal-econschool/playlists) on 

i. demand 
ii. general equilibrium 
iii. solved problems 
iv. convxity


if you want a video approach for numerical solution browse videos of these channels.

i. [economics in many lessons](https://www.youtube.com/c/EconomicsinManyLessons/playlists)



other thing you can follow

i. economics stack exchange.
ii. amit goyals quora page on microeconomics solution. He is also in economics stack exchange.

if you want to solve further general equilibrim question and more difficult problems you can refer foreign university pages. They provide good problem sets. These problem sets are more or less copied by coaching institutes in India . If you ever take coaching you will realize that many peb practice  questions are either from [mit ocw]() or [problems sets by professors]()

try this problem set by [mawalker](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mwalker/Exercises/)


there are some question comes from hecksher olhin theory and trade models. use this link by [suranovic](http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch60/Tch60.php)

some problem sets for trade model [alander 441](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/courses/441/ps/) . solve problem set 2 and 3 only.

But let assume you do not understand much of economics but you are interested. Then try this book out .[core econ]()


**Macroeconomics**

They are asking basic question. Solow model seems to be their favorite question

Try to read directly these two if you have already read froyen/makiw/blanchard

- [ucla 102](https://fgeerolf.com/econ102/) (If you like maths)
- [george lukynov](https://sites.google.com/view/glukyanov/teaching)

Then you can read any of one book. One book may not have all the chapters so you can just use other book to read that chapter. I am saying this because nobody has time to read everything.

list

1. dornbush and fisher
2. mankiw adavnce macro
3. abel and bernake
4. froyen

you can refer this [recommendation](listmathstat.html) for which book you can choose.

Btw there is always internet.

**Mathematics and statistics**



Reading alpha chiang once helps. especially the chapter on  optimization

This is the portion you can use online reference extensively.

some indicative list topic wise

- for concavity and covexity = [amit giyal]() + [osborne utornto math]()
- for convergence use [paul maths]()
- calculus finding derivative and integration- [3blue 1 brown]() + [paul maths]
- theory of polynomaial equation -[byju]()+[ctanujit]()
- for vector spaces, liner algebra [gajendra purohit youtube]()

for statistics

you can read freund's mathematical statistics and sheldon ross probabilty.

for econometrics part simply solve [gujrati porter gunasekhar ](). For that you have to read the book. solve end chapter exercise and mcq. 




Now if you want to practice mcq ?everything is not isi type question but you will able to check your knowledge on economics
