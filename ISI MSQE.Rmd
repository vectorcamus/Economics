3. Books

**Microeconomics**

Look at the question paper. Everyhing more or less an Intermediate level optimization problem with sound  economic logic. You need to know optimal consumption bundle, production bundle, properties of market and respective equilibrium, game theory solution, optimal wages and allocation as well as general equilibrium.

for basic production you can refer [osborne utoronto](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/2x3/tutorial/index.html)

You can read hal varian and snyder nicholson. This is the traditional combination. But Hal varian itseld does not have numericals. I t has a test bank and workbook. You can do it selectively as most of us do not have time to solve all the question.snyder nicholson can be read and end each chapter exercise are helpful both for pea and peb perspective.

but there are 2 books which works as a nice alternative and have integrated combination  theory and numericals.

i. Intermediate microeconomics by samiran banerjee, a tool building approch.
2. Intermediate micro by garcia 


just look at the books approch.

samiran banerjee chapter 2 has a portion called non competitive budget. read that. in garcia book you will know how to find income and substitution effect.

special mention- amit goyals [you tube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmitGoyal-econschool/playlists) on i. demand and ii.general equilibrium iii.solved problems iv.convxity


There are other 2 channels if you have time or if you want a video approch for numerical solution

- [economicurtis](https://www.youtube.com/c/economicurtis/playlists)


other thing you can follow
i. economics stack exchange.
ii. amit goyals quora page on microeconomics solution. He is also in economics stack exchange.

if you want to solve further general equilibrim question and more difficult problems you can refer foreign university pages. They provid egood problem set. These problem sets are more or less copied by coaching institutes in india . If you ever take coaching you will realize that either many peb practice  questions are either from [mit ocw] or [problems sets by professors]

try this problem set by [mawalker](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mwalker/Exercises/)


there are some question comes from hecksher olhin theory and trade models. use this link by [suranovic](http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch60/Tch60.php)

some problem sets for trade model [alander 441](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/courses/441/ps/) . solve problem set 2 and 3 only.

But let assume you do not understand much of economics but you are interested. Then try this book out .[core econ]


**Macroeconomics**

They are asking basic question. Solow model seems to be their favrouit question

Try to read directly these two if you have already read froyen/makiw/blanchard

- [ucla 102](https://fgeerolf.com/econ102/) (If you like maths)
- [george lukynov](https://sites.google.com/view/glukyanov/teaching)

Then you can read any of one book. One book may not have all the chapters so you can just use other book to read that chapter. I am saying this becasue nobody has time to reasd everything.

list
1. dornbush and fisher
2. mankiw adavnce macro
3. abel and bernake
4. froyen

you can refere this recoomandation for which book you can choose.

Btw there is alwasy intnret.

other problems sets
- [mit ocw]()


**Mathematics and statistics**



reading alpha chaoing once helps. especially th eoptimization

This is the portion you can use online reference extensively.

some indicative list topic wise

- for concavity and covexity = [amit giyal]() + [osborne utornto math]()
- for convergence use [paul maths]()
- calculus finding derivative and integration- [3blue 1 brown]() + [paul maths]
- theory of polynomaial equation -[byju]()+[ctanujit]()
- for vector spaces, liner algebra [gajendra purohit youtube]()

for statistics

you can read freunds mathematical statistics and sheldon ross probabilty.

 i have personally made/collected 20-30 important questions for each topic. You can try [here]()
 
 
 Above list is indiactive. You can make your own list. Internet has so many websites. At the end of day if youno  and cans olve problems at stipulated time wthan that is all that matters.
