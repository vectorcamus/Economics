64. Suppose $\alpha$ 

is a real number between 0 and 1. Rohit is choosing 𝑥 and 𝑦 to maximize the following utility function: 

$$𝑈(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑥^2 + 2𝑥𝑦 + 𝑦^2 + 4𝛼^2 + 8𝛼 + 10$$ subject to the following constraints: 2𝑥 + 𝑦 = 10, 𝑥, 𝑦 ≥ 0 Then the optimal value of 𝑦 chosen by Rohit is _________ ________  (in integer).

Ans. 

$x^2$

\x^2
$u=𝑥^{2} + 2𝑥𝑦 + 𝑦^2 + 4𝛼^2 + 8𝛼 + 10$ is monotonic transformation of 
$x^2 +2xy +y^2$ which is another monotonic transformation of 
$U=x+y$.
Here , MRS=1
Hence, They are perfect substitutes. 
As MRS$\neq\frac{p_x}{p_y}$  it's a corner solution.

| Bundles |Utils|
|---|---|
|$(5,0)$|5 utils|
|$(0,10)$|10 utils|
Hence, the optimal solution is $(0,10)$ and $y*=10$

Alternatively , 
AS mrs indicates perfect substitution between two goods the consumer should consume the good which has lower price. in this cas $p_y<p_x$ and consumer will spend all his/her income on y. so with income 10 the consumer can buy $\frac{M}{p_y}=\frac{10}{1}=10$ units of $y$. 

13. Piku faces a lottery with utcome of INR 24, INR 12, INR 48 and INR 6 given by the following probbaility distibution.
|Lottery income|24|12|48|6|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Probability outcome|$\frac{2}{6}$|$\frac{3}{6}$|$\frac{1}{6}$|$0$|
she is indifferent between lottery and eceiving INR 28 with certanity . given the information we can conclude that piku is a $___________$
Ans.
Expected value of lottery = $E(X)=\sum p_i x_i= 24(\frac{2}{6})+12(\frac{3}{6})+48(\frac{1}{6})+6(0)=8+6+8+0=22$
she is indifferent between getting INR 22 by playing and getting INR 28 with certanity.
she is definately a risk lover person. 

27. Suppose that a firm has a technology represented by the following production function: $𝑌(𝐾, 𝐿) = 𝐾^x 𝐿^y$ where K denotes capital, L denotes labour, Y denotes the maximum output that is possible to produce using capital K and labour L. 𝑥 and 𝑦 are two positive real numbers. It is also known that the production function satisfies constant returns to scale. Then which of the following is true? 
- (A) $𝑥 + 𝑦 = 0.5$ 
- (B) $𝑥 + 𝑦 = 1$
- (C) $𝑥 + 𝑦 = 1.5$ 
- (D) $𝑥 + 𝑦 = 2$
Ans.
$x+y=1$
why ?
let say $\alpha>0$
so for $Y(\alpha K, \alpha L)= (\alpha K)^x (\alpha L)^y= \alpha^x K^x \alpha^y L^y= \alpha^{x+y} K^x L^y = \alpha^{x+y} F(K,L)$
so the function is constant return to scale if $Y(\alpha K,\alpha L)=\alpha F(K,L)$
This is only possible if $\alpha^{x+y} F(K,L)=\alpha F(K,L)$
Hence 
$x+y=1$
