<p>Land system during British period was responsible for sustained
poverty in Indian and stagnant growth of Indian economy. Discuss.**</p>
</div>
<div id="answer" class="section level2">
<h2>Answer:</h2>
<ul>
<li>British land revenue system raised some problems which led to
sustained poverty and stagnant growth in the Indian economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues associated with British land revenue system</p>
<p><strong>Disruption of traditional mechanism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Landlord now had property rights over the lands in his jurisdiction,
instead of tiller. Tillers became tenants who could be summarily
dismissed. It pushed many tenants towards severe poverty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Growth of ABSENTEE LANDLORDISM</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rent payment in money format led to growth of moneylenders.
Moneylenders used to charge high interest rate. It reduced surplus for
farmers and led to lower investments in agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevented growth of capitalist farming in India</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It led to decline in productivity . According to Blyn growth rate
was just 0.72%. Thus India has to resort to food import.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small size of landholdings because large landowners leased out their
holdings to many small farmers;</li>
<li>Zamindar didn’t invest because his land could be confiscated on non
payment of rent</li>
<li>Tenant didn’t invest because of frequent transfer of land and all
benefits accruing to the land owner</li>
<li>Given high rents, many farmers moved from growing food crops to cash
crops like cotton and sugarcane, leading to famines. Thus it can be said
that land system during British period was responsible for sustained
poverty in Indian and stagnant growth of Indian economy.</li>

<p><strong>Write about the policy of discriminating protection during
the British rule and its impact on industrial development in
India.</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Until the First World War, the government followed a policy of
LAISSEZ FAIRE in the promotion of industry. However to strengthen
finances and pacify Indian nationalist, after world war 1 government
adapted policy of discriminating protection. It raised some of the
tariff on imports.</p>
<p>Economic Consequence of discrimination protection</p>
<p>Some Increase in tariff take place, hence it Protected the Indian
industries. This led to diversification of industrial base and new
factories came up in sugar, iron and steel, matches, paper.
Manufacturing grew @ 5.6% between 1920 and 1938 Industries like Tata and
Birla expanded for example eg Tata entered into Aviation sector. However
protection was only to the industries which had Natural Advantage. These
were mostly those goods that did not create Competition with Britain .
But, their competition was more with other countries especially Japan.
Hence gains were limited that to to few industries. As a result of this
discriminations export share of Britain rose to 35%.</p>

<li>Why socialist model of development could not bring about equitable
distribution of income in India and the country remained on a slow
growth trajectory of 3 to 3.5 percent for a long time? Discuss.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Looking at socio economic condition prevailing at that time, India
adapted socialist order. However it could not bring about equitable
distribution of income and faster growth of the economy.</p>
<p>Reasons of failure of socialist model</p>
<p>In planning system focus was on capital industries rather than
agriculture and consumer industries. High gestation period of capital
industries deprived common Indians. Thus benefits of growth did not
reach to marginal sections.</p>
<p>System of import controls which was designed to conserve scarce
foreign exchange, actually served only to provide open-ended protection
for domestic producers against foreign competition. It led to a high
cost and low quality domestic production structure. Thus it slowed
growth of the manufacturing.</p>
<p>Protections to SSI and excessive regulation of large scale industries
prevented growth of manufacturing. Thus employment creation was very
low. In addition to that there were many regulations like MRTP,
Licensing, FERA, etc. Thus all paved way for crony socialism. Benefits
of growth was cornered by few people. It led to unequitable
distribution.</p>
<p>Looking at that situation of socialist model, India decided to open
up and go for market economy.</p>

<li>Specify the main factors which hindered trickle-down in Indian
economy and agenda of ‘inclusive growth’ is being pressed into for
economic justice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The trickle-down theory, argues that growth would lead to more jobs,
more output, more income and less poverty as the growth and higher
incomes at the top end will move at the lower end and to the poor.</p>
<p>Factors which hindered trickle down in Indian economy</p>
<p>Indian economic development in earlier year has given less importance
to the agriculture and consumer goods and gave more importance to
capital good manufacturing. Capital good manufacturing are labor
intensive and high gestation period thus it does not benefitted
poor.</p>
<p>After 1980 service sector grow faster than agriculture and
manufacturing. Service sector is less employment elastic than the
manufacturing or agricultural sector. Thus it led to jobless growth.
Jobless growth is major reason for slow trickle down.</p>
<p>India before 1991 saw crony socialism and later after reforms it was
converted to crony capitalism. It benefitted rich and excluded poor. At
the same time there was little public investment on education and
health. It limited capability development of poor. This factors together
lead to slow and incomplete trickle down in the Indian economy.</p>

<li>What are the consequences of deviation from socialistic pattern of
society and mixed economy particularly for the persons below the poverty
line? Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In 1991 India shifted from socialistic pattern of society to the
liberalisation. Lets analyse its consequences for the person below
BPL.</p>
<p>World Bank study by Gaurav Datt suggest that poverty declined by 1.36
percentage points per annum after 1991, compared to that of 0.44
percentage points per annum prior to 1991. Telndulkar committee report
also suggest that poverty rate declined from 45% in 1991 to 22% in 2011.
This indicates reforms were successful in reducing poverty. It raised
the standard of life for BPL families.</p>
<p>But Himanshu’s study suggest that it was PDS and MGNREGA which
reduced poverty and not the reforms. It can be seen that India after
reforms is seeing jobless growth. It is impacting BPL families most.
Inequalities have also increased thus relative standard of living is
worsen for poor. Privatization of school and hospitals and low public
spending on education and hospitals are impacting poor.</p>
<p>After 1991 reforms absolute poverty decreased. But it marginally
improved standard of living of poor. There is need to focus on inclusive
growth so that poor also get equal benefit of growth.</p>

<li>Answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Elaborate growth-mediated security and support-led security
strategies of poverty alleviation given by Jean Dreze and Amartya
Sen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Amartya Sen and Jean Dereze have brought out two approaches to reduce
poverty – growth mediated security and support-led security. Poverty
reduction and income expansion achieved through high economic growth is
called ‘growth mediated security’.</p>
<p>Support led security is achievement of growth and poverty reduction
through wide ranging public support is given in areas such as
’employment provision, income redistribution, health care, education and
social assistance in order to improve distribution without waiting for a
transformation in the level of general affluence.</p>
<p>Sen advocates approach of building capability through investment in
education and health. He suggest that growth of India is not reflected
in significant reduction in poverty, employment generation and human
capital development. Thus there is now need to make growth inclusive.
State should investment in education and health right away without
waiting for being rich and then redistribution.</p>

<li>Do you think Gandhian vision of development is still relevant in
India? Explain with reasons.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Gandhian vision of development was based on decentralization
development by empowering local self governments at grass root level.
Socialism is another basic philosophical entity of Gandhianism. Although
Gandhian view of socialism is not radical in its approach but it aspires
for a classless society with no poverty, no hunger, no unemployment and
education and health for all.</p>
<p>Gandhi aims at what we may call sustainable development. Thus his
ideas are still relevant in today’s India. His emphasis on
decentralization development is still relevant. Its success can be seen
in the form of MGNREGA and community led development. His vision to make
cottage industries as engine of growth can be way towards Atmanirbhar
Bharat.</p>
<p>His views on school are very relevant in todays world. Nayi Talim
school system gives practical education to children. Its modified
version can help to fulfill dream of skill India.</p>
<p>Development should be targeted to eradicate poverty, hunger,
unemployment. It should provide health and education to all. These are
exactly objectives of many government schemes.</p>
<p>His ideas may not be adapted as it is. His opposition to
mechanization can be counter productive in today’s world. But basic
philosophy of Gandhian development can still be guiding light for
India’s development process.</p>

<li>Why are land reforms still not complete in India? What are the
obstacles in its way? Elaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Land reforms has important components like Zamindari abolition,
tenancy regulation, land ceiling and land consolidation. However it has
limited success. According to P S Appu, by 1992, ownership right
conferred to only 4% of cultivated area. According to Haque, on the
national scale only 1/3rd of the consolidatable area has been
consolidated.</p>
<p>Reasons for failure of land reforms</p>
<p>Zamindar used loopholes in clause of personal cultivation. voluntary
surrender clause was used as a guise. It lead to forceful eviction. To
evade land ceiling clause, zamindar made benami transfers or transferred
land in the names of other members of a households. Property right was
recognized as fundamental right. It led to several disputes in courts.
Many states did not passed law on time. UP took four and half year to
pass law. Strong tenancy regulation led to informalization of tenancy.
Tenants were renamed as farm servants or sharecroppers. In many states
land ceiling limit was very high. Indian’s have emotional attachment
with land. Thus it created problems for land consolidation. PS Appu
blamed apathy of bureaucracy and politicians for unsuccessful land
reforms. Thus except abolition of Zamindari all other reforms more or
less incomplete.</p>

<li>Answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Why Green Revolution lost its steam and India needs yet another
Green Revolution or Evergreen Revolution? Discuss.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In 1965 government of India introduced green revolution program. It
was characterized by use High yield verities, chemical fertilizers,
machineries, farmer education, government procurement, minimum support
price, etc.</p>
<p>Between 1967-1970 food production rose by 35%. Food grain production
increased from 75mt to 105mt in 1971. Agriculture growth increased from
0.8% to 3%. India became self sufficient in food production. Our current
food grain production is 250mt. It was helpful in commercialization of
agriculture.</p>
<p>However Green revolution assistance was cereal centric. Thus its
success was limited to cereals. Pulses production dropped from 61mg per
capita to 42 mg per capita now. It is seen that it was limited to
Punjab, Haryana and western UP. Eastern and north eastern sector was
ignored.</p>
<p>Increased mechanization reduced employment elasticity of the
agriculture. It increased rural distress. It is also seen that increased
fertilizer use deteriorated environment and soil quality. Productivity
might further decrease due to global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>The technologies used in green revolution are showing decreasing
return to scale. In the recent time agricultural growth has been
stagnated. It showed that impact of green revolution was limited and
there is need of sustainable evergreen revolution.</p>

<li>Highlight the structural changes in Indian economy before 1991.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Structural changes in economy before 1991 can be analyzed in three
phases. First phase between 1951 to 1965. Second phase between 1965 to
1980 and last phase between 1980 and 1990</p>
<p>1951 – 1965</p>
<p>After independence India adapted strategy of planned economy. During
this period focus was on setting up capital industries. PSU were given
role of commanding heights. In this period agricultural share goes down
and capital industries share increased in GDP.</p>
<p>1965-1980</p>
<p>This phase in known for inward orientation and industrial stagnation.
During this period India realized importance of agriculture. Policy of
green revolution was launched during this period. It made India self
sufficient.</p>
<p>However policies like MRTP, FERA, reservation for small scale
industries, etc created inefficiencies. It stagnated industrial growth.
This led to stagnation in GDP growth rate at 3.5%.</p>
<p>1980-1990</p>
<p>During this period growth started exceeding 5% mark. According to
Subramaniam pro business attitude change and reforms like MRTP
relaxation, decrease in tax law helped economy to grow. Panagaria called
it most significant structural change.</p>
<p>India’s growth rate in pre reform period was low compared to its
potential. Low growth can be contributed to excessive regulation, anti
business environment and licence raj.</p>

<li>Answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme should be reoriented to
create productive permanent assets to promote employment and generate
income in the rural sector. Critically evaluate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In 2005 MGNREGA was started. Its aim was to provided 100 days
guaranteed employment to unskilled population. The scheme has potential
to change fate of rural area.</p>
<p>MGNREGA is aimed at unskilled population. There is need of skilling
of MNREGA workers through Deen Dayal Upaadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana
for vertical mobility of labour towards skilled work. This will help
realizing the dream of Skill India. It will increase productivity and
thus will create better opportunities for workers.</p>
<p>The scheme should be converged with other schemes of agriculture,
irrigation, road transport and animal husbandry, water management etc.
There is need of sharing of costs for each component – wage and material
by center and state so that there is no bias towards high labor cost
projects.</p>
<p>Permitting contractors within the overall ceiling of material
component to include skilled and semi-skilled workers would lead to
speedy and effective implementation of the projects and improve the
quality of assets created. It would improve the employment availability
as well as income generations.</p>
<p>Thus there is need to reorient MGNREGA. MGNREGA 2.0 should aim at
creating productive permanent assets, to promote employment and generate
income in the rural sector.</p>

<li>What are the factors responsible for large number of farmers
suicides in relatively richer Indian States? Examine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Relatively richer states like Maharashtra and Karnataka are seeing
increasing number of farmer suicides. There are various socio economic
reasons.</p>
<p>Factors Responsible for large number of farmers suicide</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Day by day cost of farming has increase. There is surge in input
cost, fertilizers cost, labor cost. But at the same time agriculture
marker is highly volatile. It led to frequent losses for the farmers. It
creates distress for farmers.</p>
<p>Due to volatility in prices there is less surplus remain to repay the
loan and run the livelihood. Thus there are cases of loan defaults for
farmers.</p>
<p>Environmental Factors</p>
<p>Farming activity is highly dependent on environmental factors.
Drought or heavy rainfall may damage crop. In the Maharashtra region
suicide is prevalent in Vidarbha. It is rainfed region. A drought season
destroys crop which leads to farmer distress.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Social evils like dowry, alcoholism is pushing farmers towards debt
trap. It led to suicide for farmers.</p>
<p>We need to tackle socio, economic and environmental problems at the
same time to deal with problems of suicide.</p>

<li>In Indian economy, dichotomy of development emerged during the
pre-reform period despite efforts of holistic development. Delineate the
factors responsible for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>1980s is often cited as that breaking point when India made a
transition from an economic laggard to one of the fastest growing
nations of the world. Any increase in our GDP and per capita income is
supposed to imply an increase in our living standards. However growth
has not equated to human development and thus increased living
standards.</p>
<p>Even though the growth rate of our per capita income rose from 1.7%
in 1950-1980 period to an average of 4% thereafter, the core human
development parameters continued to be dismal . This is reflected by the
fact that India’s relative rank in human development among 177 countries
has risen by only two positions from 128 in 1999 to 126 in 2004.
Education, health and security continued to be ignored which led to poor
development.</p>
<p>Amartya Sen emphasized, while the case of economic reforms of 1980s
and 1991 correctly diagnosed too much governance in some sectors of the
economy, it ignored the fact that India had too less governance in other
fields like education, healthcare, social security, and land reforms.
This led to dichotomy of growth and development.</p>

<li>Answer the following questions in about 150 words each:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Highlight the issues of Bhagwati-Sen controversy over tackling
poverty and slow growth rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>There is debate going on between Sen and Bhagwati over issues of
growth and distribution.</p>
<p>Bhagwati’s Approach</p>
<p>Bhagwati focuses more on growth than distribution. He thinks more
liberalization, privatization and foreign trade will promote growth. He
points out that economic growth will lead to reduction in poverty.
According to him economic growth will increase employment opportunities
and thus reduces poverty. Economic growth increased revenue for the
government thus government can now spend more on health, education and
social welfare schemes. He suggested that in the country where the poor
exceeds rich by large margin, redistribution will increase welfare of
poor marginally.</p>
<p>However empirical evidence confirms that growth not necessarily
generates adequate employment &amp; thus it will be difficult to tackle
poverty. India is seeing similar jobless growth.</p>
<p>Sen’s Approach</p>
<p>Sen advocates approach of building capability through investment in
education and health. Unlike Bhagwati he does not consider, growth first
and then redistribution. He suggest that growth of India is not
reflected in significant reduction in poverty, employment generation and
human capital development. Thus there is now need to make growth
inclusive. State should investment in education and health right away
without waiting for being rich and then redistribution. He was not
against liberalization but he gave priority to investment in education
and health. However Sen’s view underplays importance of infrastructure
and physical capital.</p>
<p>What required is balanced between strategy of Sen and Bhagwati. There
is need to have equal emphasis on human capital development and rapid
growth with capital accumulation.</p>

<li>While Indian economic growth in recent years is services-led growth
and Chinese model is manufacturing-led growth, show the implications of
the two models for long-term sustainable development.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>India’s policy of liberalization was aimed at increasing industrial
growth. However manufacturing share in GDP remain stagnated at 16% while
service sector share increased to 60% from 40%. On other hand China’s
share of manufacturing in GDP was highest. .</p>
<p>Service sector is less labor intensive, thus with growth India is not
seeing growth in the employment. This jobless growth is creating
problems of inequalities and unequal distribution. It also weakens fight
against poverty. On other hand China’s manufacturing is labor intensive
and was able to generate enough jobs.</p>
<p>From the trade perspective, there is reluctance from world towards
opening trade in service sector. Thus India is not able to exploit its
trade potentials. Also over dependence on import for manufacturing goods
can be problematic for economic sovereignty.</p>
<p>Thus service led growth with stagnant manufacturing may not good for
long term sustainability. India has to work towards increasing its
manufacturing growth.</p>

<li>Employment pattern in India in post-reform period has moved in
favour of contractual, casual and self-employment. How public sector
employment deceleration would impact the future of labour (employment)
market in India? Elaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Since 1991 to 2010, informal sector employment increased from 91% to
93 %. It is increasing casualization. Even in formal sector there is
preference given for contractual workers. It might be because of complex
and rigid labor system of India.</p>
<p>Impact of casualization on future labor market</p>
<p>In contractual employment, there is less incentive in investing in
labour’s training. There is evidence that hiring contract workers today
hurts a firm’s productivity tomorrow, precisely because contract workers
do not accumulate “firm specific human capital”. It would impact long
run growth trajectory. There is increased contractualisation of
government jobs. It might create difficulties for person to switch from
government sector to private sector. Worker right protection is absent.
Thus it might lead to exploitation of labor. In the economic shock
unemployment rate might increase leading to further depression. It might
increase unwillingness to participate in labor force. It will encourage
rent seeking over investing in productive activity. The changing trend
of casualization might not be good for long term. There is need to focus
on creating social safety net and long term sustainable quality
employment.</p>

<li>Skill development and thereby raising productivity like that in
China would be the only panacea for long-term growth in Indian economy.
Discuss.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Endogenous growth model suggest that for long run sustainable
economic growth there is need to focus on human capital development.
Without it growth process could be converging and stagnant. India is
currently facing skill gap.</p>
<p>India skill report suggests that only 48% of graduated students are
employable. Unskilled population hindrance development of manufacturing
industry. With the advent of fourth industrial revolution it might
aggravate problems of of unemployment and poverty.</p>
<p>Skill development is an important driver to address poverty reduction
by improving employability, productivity and helping sustainable
enterprise development and inclusive growth. It facilitates a cycle of
high productivity, increased employment opportunities, income growth and
development.</p>
<p>The increase in productivity could be due to availability of skilled
&amp; healthy manpower; technological up gradation and innovative
practices. Thus India has to focus on these factors to ensure long term
sustainable growth.</p>

<li>Second generation economic reforms are crucial for raising the
growth rate of economy. Throw light on these dimensions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Second generation of economic reforms in the country gave special
stress on fiscal reforms, financial reforms, structural reforms, labour
law reforms etc.</p>
<p>Fiscal reforms has to undertaken for broadening the income tax base
and introducing GST. There is also need to streamline tax structure so
that it become conducive to growth.</p>
<p>It is seen that complex and rigid labor laws are major hinderance in
the development of manufacturing sector. Its streamlining will ensure
the growth of manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>India has to work on improving Ease of Doing Business. It will help
to attract foreign capital in India. Currently red tapism is hindering
growth process. Single window system and digital system can reduce the
delay.</p>
<p>Agriculture growth has been stagnated from long time. There is need
to focus on agricultural reforms. Liberalisation of agriculture market
and investment in the capital infrastructure will increase the growth
rate of agriculture.</p>
<p>Thus second generation will remove bottlenecks in the development of
Indian economy. It will help us to achieve double digit growth rate.</p>
<p>Note : Most of the reforms are implemented. Another interest thing is
second generation reform term was coined by IMF. But even IMF has not
defined it. So basically you can write any reforms.</p>

<li>What are the salient features of FRBM Act? Examine the criticisms
labelled against it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>To limit the fiscal deficit FRBM act was introduced.</p>
<p>Salient features of FRBM Act</p>
<p>It aims at reducing fiscal deficit to 6% (3% of the central
government and 3% of the state government). Revenue deficit should be
eliminated. Government in required to submit four documents in
parliament Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy
Statement, Macroeconomic Framework Statement and Medium Term Expenditure
Framework Statement On grounds of national security, calamity, etc, the
set targets of fiscal deficits and revenue could be exceeded. Criticism
of FRBM act</p>
<p>It is criticized that 3% target of FRBM is arbitrarily set. Some also
criticize that it puts excessive limit on government expenditure.
However it is actually ensuring expenditure switching from revenue
expenditure to capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Another issue with FRBM act is that the limit on fiscal deficit is
frequently breached and act is frequently amended. Thus NK Singh
committee suggested using debt as the primary target for fiscal policy
and that the target must be achieved by 2023.</p>

<li>Discuss the issues involved in Capital Account Convertibility. In
the light of this, explain India’s important Capital Account
Liberalization measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Capital account convertibility refers to, freedom to convert local
financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa at market
determined rates of exchange There are continuous demands for full
capital account convertibility. However it has some issues involved.</p>
<p>In the good economic situation full capital account convertibility
might lead to excessive capital inflow appreciates currency. It affects
our export competitiveness. Due to economic shock there could be large
foreign out flow. It creates deficit in capital account which affects
BoP. In 1997 similar situation was seen in ASEAN countries which
destabilized their economies.</p>
<p>Thus India has not introduced full capital account convertibility.
But it has introduced some measures for capital account
liberalization.</p>
<p>Measures for Capital Account Liberalization</p>
<p>In many sectors automatic FDI is allowed Indian corporate is allowed
full convertibility in the automatic route up to $ 500 million overseas
ventures (investment by Ltd. companies in foreign countries allowed).
Indian corporate is allowed to prepay their external commercial
borrowings (ECBs) via automatic route if the loan is above $ 500
million. Individuals are allowed to invest in foreign assets, shares,
etc., up to the level of $ 2,50,000 per annum. Unlimited amount of gold
is allowed to be imported. Gradually by fulfilling Tarapore Committee
recommendations India should move towards full capital account
convertibility.</p>

<li>How global financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis of European
nations exposed the disturbing role of speculative motive and fiscal
imprudence? What lesson could India derive from it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The global financial crisis (GFC) refers to the period of extreme
stress in global financial markets and banking systems between mid 2007
and early 2009. The European sovereign debt crisis was a period when
several European countries experienced the collapse of financial
institutions, high government debt, and rapidly rising bond yield
spreads in government securities.</p>
<p>Theses crisis have some lessons for India. First lesson is that
financial sector issues should not be overlooked. Any excessive credit
expansion in financial market should be regulated on time. Any
speculation should be controlled before it becoming bubble.</p>
<p>Second lesson is that overleveraged state can be problematic. State
should follow the fiscal imprudence. Excessive fiscal deficit and
government deficit can damage macro economic framework of the country.
It can also lead to sovereign debt default. In the medium term it can
harm countries growth potential and credibility.</p>
<p>Third lesson is that in the globally linked world crisis anywhere is
threat to economic development everywhere. Thus India should be vigilant
on development of global crisis. In any such crisis government should be
ready to deal it with fiscal, monetary, regulatory and policy tools.</p>

<li>Answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>‘Elitist bias’ and ‘crony capitalism’ have eclipsed the issues of
efficiency and distributive justice in India. Elaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Crony capitalism is an economic system in which businesses thrive not
as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a
nexus between a business class and the political class. It creates
oligarchies and slows down growth.</p>
<p>According to Raghuram Rajan one of the greatest dangers to the growth
of developing countries is the middle income trap, where crony
capitalism creates oligarchies that slow down growth.</p>
<p>In India crony capitalism is helping few elite individuals to corner
most of the generated wealth. It is impacting distributive issues in
India. Economic Survey 2020 suggest that crony capitalism has impacted
efficiency in India. Crony capitalism creates environment of
protectionism and monopoly. It impacts both consumer and total
welfare.</p>
<p>In India even after the reforms agriculture sector was largely
ignored. It is employer of 50% workforce of India. The policy making
largely focused on manufacturing and service sector. This elite biased
impacted efficiency in the agriculture.</p>
<p>Thus it can be said that ‘elitist bias’ and ‘crony capitalism’ have
eclipsed the issues of efficiency and distributive justice in India.</p>

<li>Vitalization of rural economy is key to ‘inclusive growth’ which is
possible through ‘strategic management’ and technological up gradation.
Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>India’s 65% population lives in rural area. India’s 50% workforce is
dependent on agriculture. Agriculture is dominantly rural occupation
thus vitalization of rural economy is key to inclusive growth.</p>
<p>Vitalisation of rural economy</p>
<p>Strategic Management</p>
<p>Strategic management involves setting objectives, analyzing the
competitive environment, evaluating strategies, and ensuring that
government rolls out the strategies. Agriculture is strength of rural
area. Government can set objectives of all round development around
agriculture. It can focus on creating completive environment for the
growth of agriculture and allied industries, government can focus on
development of rural infrastructure.</p>
<p>Technological up gradation</p>
<p>Access to internet in rural area will help in improvement of
education. It also opens jobs opportunities in digital sector.
Technological upgradation in agriculture sector improves productivity.
Technology of food processing, storage, food transports adds value to
the agricultural production. Rural area is dominated by MSMEs.
Technological upgradation in MSMEs improves their profitability and thus
employment opportunities. Technological upgradation of infrastructure
reduces logistic cost. It will help to attract investment in rural
area.</p>
<p>Thus vitalization of rural economy is key to ‘inclusive growth’ which
is possible through ‘strategic management’ and technological up
gradation.</p>

<li>How could e-governance tackle the issues of corruption and
inefficiency in the government sector to lead to higher growth rate in
the economy? Discuss.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Under the digital India scheme government is pushing for e governance
initiatives. It has ability yo tackle issues of corruption and
inefficiencies.</p>
<p>The red tapism and corruption are hampering India’s growth rate. E
governance can improve this. Single window system, form simplification
and field reduction, online applications and tracking, etc can
significantly reduce red tapism and corruption.</p>
<p>Tax system of India is reformed through faceless assessment. It
reduces contact between officials and tax payers. Thus it reduces cases
of corruption. Similarly now tax filing can be done online thus has
become very simple process.</p>
<p>MyGov aims to establish a link between Government and Citizens
towards meeting the goal of good governance. It encourages citizens as
well as people abroad to participate in various activities i.e. ‘Do’,
‘Discuss’, ‘Poll’, ‘Talk’, ‘Blog’, etc. People participation increases
accountability and reduces corruptions.</p>
<p>E governance can increases transparency and accountability of the
system. Online process fastens the file movement. Thus it can be said
that e governance, is a significant instrument of tackling the issues of
corruption and inefficiency in the government sector.</p>

<li>Answer the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Subsidy is a contentious issue and roadblock in the WTO. Examine
India’s stand for protecting its farmer’s interests.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Subsidies are contentious issue and roadblock in the WTO. Developed
and developing world are divided over the issues of subsidies.</p>
<p>In the WTO developed countries are allowed to maintain trade
distorting subsidies or ‘Amber box’ subsidies (AMS) to level of 5% of
total value of agricultural output and for developing countries this
figure was 10% of agricultural output. This domestic price support is
calculated as the difference between the fixed external reference price
prevailing between 1986-88.</p>
<p>According to developing countries including India the reference
period of 1986-88 is outdated . Thee base year in general had an
exceptionally lower prices also it fails to count in the high inflation
in developing countries. Developing countries argue that they need to be
given flexibility to stock enough grains for the food security of
millions of their poor.</p>
<p>Another contention is over domestic price support provided by
developed country. Developed country have already used Amber box
subsidies which are now restricted for the less developed countries.</p>
<p>Developed countries are heavily subsidizing their agriculture by
export subsidies, food aid program, credit guarantee scheme, etc.
Farmer’s of the developed countries are also relatively rich. But now
this WTO restrictions on agricultural subsidies are impacting food
security and farmer welfare in developing countries.</p>
<p>India has taken firm stand that will not accept any limits on
subsidies on farm inputs such as seeds and fertilizers. India is
committed to protect food security and welfare of the farmers.</p>

<li>Write on the Look East Policy of India.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Look East Policy of India was launched in 1991 by the Government of
India led by the former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. The objective was
to develop political, economic and security co-operation with countries
in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The results of India’s ‘Look East’ policy are also amply demonstrated
in our growing economic interaction with the region. India’s trade with
Asean has risen from US $2.4 billion in 1990, to US $23 billion in 2005.
Our trade with the countries of the East Asia Summit has, similarly,
risen from US $8 billion in 1990, to US $67.6 billion in 2005. This
accounts for nearly 30% of our external trade. At the same time, the
period has also seen an increase in FDI flows, both from India to the
region and region to India.</p>
<p>In the present phase of our ‘Look East’ policy, we in India seek to
deepen our economic integration by entering into Free Trade or
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements, both with Asean as a
whole and with individual countries of the region. Such agreements are
already under different stages of discussion or implementation with
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>In the recent time India wanted to increase ties with ASEAN. Thus
Look East Policy has been replaced by the Act East Policy.</p>

<li>Write for and against FDI in retail trade of India.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In India FDI in retail sector is not allowed. There are both support
and opponents of allowing FDI in retail sector.</p>
<p>Why to allow FDI in retail trade?</p>
<p>FDI in retail trade will boost growth in the economy. Due to its
economies of scale it generates many jobs from office assistant,
delivery boy to high level management jobs. Due to less intermediaries
it will benefit farmers. Due to its economies of scale, prices will be
reduced. It will benefit to consumers. Also FDI in retail trade will
boost infrastructure, storage facilities, new technology development.
Thus FDI in retail sector can play conducive role in economic
development.</p>
<p>Why not to allow FDI in retail trade?</p>
<p>Retail sector is employer of many small shopkeepers and households.
Their volume is very low. On contrary FDI will have big pockets. They
can buy goods at bulk quantity at low prices and thus can give heavy
discount. It will disrupt economy of small shop keepers. Once the small
shopkeepers economy weakens, large FDI players can establish monopoly.
It will hurt consumer welfare in long run. Thus we need precautions to
allow FDI in retail sectors.</p>
